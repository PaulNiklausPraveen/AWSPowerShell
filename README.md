Installing the AWS Tools for PowerShell on Windows
 
A Windows-based computer can run any of the AWS Tools for PowerShell package options:

AWS.Tools: The modularized version of AWS Tools for PowerShell. Each AWS service is supported by its own individual, small module, with shared support modules AWS.Tools.Common and AWS.Tools.Installer.

AWSPowerShell.NetCore: The single, large-module version of AWS Tools for PowerShell. All AWS services are supported by this single, large module.

AWSPowerShell: The legacy Windows-specific, single, large-module version of AWS Tools for PowerShell. All AWS services are supported by this single, large module.

Note: The package you choose depends on the release and edition of Windows that you're running.
